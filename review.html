		<h1>Suzanne Collins Website</h1>
		<p>This website is really bad. For starters the navigation is far to the right. The welcome and intorduction is far to the left.The pictures are all over the place. Everything is just in a random place. The layout doesnt make sense to me, how everything is place is just confusing. Her coding is messy and confusing. Just how everything is placed really throws me off. Navigation is horrible, information all over the place and isnt centered. Not a whole bunch of colors were used. Alot of white space. Nothing amazes me about this website, its a mess. Link: http://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/ </p>

<h2>Exmouth View Hotel</h2>
<p>This website is pretty bad as well for many reasons. Everything is kind of all over the place as well. There really is no header. When you look at the website, you really dont know what to look at first. The page isnt centered. There are a bunch of random links on the side of the page. The HTML is old and they didnt put alot of work into it. Not alot of information or anything built in the HTML. The only upside to the page is that there are links to some relevant activities that customers could do in town. Not alot of colors, one plain blue color on the page. There is no order to the page whatsoever. Link: http://www.exmouth-view.co.uk/ </p>

<h3>Lakers Website</h3>
        <p>This website is very professional. The navigation is amaing. You have alot to choose from and the flow of the page is great. The graphics and pictures are very professional and appealing to the eye. The colors are good and they compliment each other. Everything is in order, go from one thing to another, everything is centered as well. The codig is modrn and very advanced. They have graphics in motion that i find very cool as well. They connected their social media pages to the main page as well. Everything you need is attached, very complex and professional. Link:https://www.nba.com/lakers/?tmd=1 </p>
